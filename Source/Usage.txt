Ground Track Generator outputs GIS-compatible shapefiles containing point or
line segment representations of the ground track of specified satellite orbits.
The extent and resolution of the ground track is controlled by the TRACE OPTIONS
described below. Orbit information is read from two-line element sets and the
orbit is modelled with the SGP4/SDP4 simplified perturbation model.

OPTIONS:

  INPUT OPTIONS:

    --tle/-t TEXT
        Load two-line element sets directly from TEXT.

    --input/-i PATH
        Load two-line element sets from file PATH.

    TLE [TLE ...]
        Any command line arguments not interpreted as the options or arguments
        described here are treated as the PATH to two-line element set files.

    If no two-line element sets (TLEs) are loaded from the command line, gtg
    will attempt to read two-line element sets from standard input. If multiple
    TLEs are loaded, a separate shapefile will be output for each TLE.

  OUTPUT OPTIONS:

    --format/-m shapefile | csv
        Select output format. Shapefile is default. If csv output is selected,
        a comma-separated value is output, including id, latitude, longitude,
        and any other specified attributes. If no --output argument is provided
        in csv, data is written to standard output instead of a default file.
    
    --header/-h
    	Include a header row in csv output. No effect with any other --format.
    
    --output/-o PATH | DIRECTORY
        If a single two-line element set is loaded, specify the base PATH of the
        output (defaults to the TLE identifier described below).
        If multiple two-line element sets are loaded, specify the directory in
        which to write output files (defaults to current working directory).

    --prefix/-p PREFIX
        If specified, PREFIX is prepended to the base name identifier, unless
        there is only one two-line element set and an --output PATH is given.

    --suffix/-x SUFFIX
        If specified, SUFFIX is appended to the base name identifier, unless
        there is only one two-line element set and an --output PATH is given.

    --noprj
        Suppress output of .prj "projection" file, which explicitly specifies
        the geodetic reference system of the generated shapefile (WGS-72).

    The default base name for output files is the [NORAD] satellite number
    encoded in the second field of the first line of the two-line element set.

  GEOMETRY OPTIONS:

    --features/-f point | line
        Specify whether to output points (the default) or line segment features
        for each step. Attributes refer to the starting point of line features.

    --split/-d
        If generating line --features, split any lines that cross the 180th
        meridian into east and west hemisphere segments. Disabled by default.
      IMPORTANT: --split is intended as a cosmetic convenience only. The split
        point latitude is not determined with the same precision as the trace.

  ATTRIBUTE OPTIONS:

    --attributes/-a all | standard | ATTRIBUTE [ATTRIBUTE ...]
        By default, no attributes are output.
            all       - Output all attributes. Some require an --observer.
            standard  - All attributes except those which require an observer.
        Alternatively, list one or more of the following ATTRIBUTE names:
            time      - Step timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS UTC
            unixtime  - Step timestamp in seconds since 0:0:0 UTC 1 Jan 1970.
            mfe       - Relative timestamp in minutes from epoch.
            altitude  - Altitude of satellite in km.
            velocity  - Magnitude of satellite velocity in km/s.
            heading   - Direction of motion in degrees clockwise from north.
            latitude  - Geodetic latitude of satellite position.
            longitude - Geodetic longitude of satellite position.
            xposition - Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) x position in km.
            yposition - Satellite ECI y position in km.
            zposition - Satellite ECI z position in km.
            xvelocity - Satellite ECI x velocity in km/s.
            yvelocity - Satellite ECI y velocity in km/s.
            zvelocity - Satellite ECI z velocity in km/s.
            range     - Range to satellite from observer in km.
            rate      - Rate of satellite range from observer in km/s.
            elevation - Elevation to satellite from observer.
            azimuth   - Azimuth to satellite from observer.
        Attributes are output in this order regardless of order specified.

    --observer/-g LATITUDE LONGITUDE [ALTITUDE]
        Specify the surface location of an observer (optional altitude in km).
        Some --attributes require an observer to be defined. None by default.

  TRACE OPTIONS:

    --start/-s now | epoch | TIME | UNIXTIME
        Timestamp for first step of output. Subsequent steps are output at
        uniform time --intervals until --end time or --steps count is reached.
            now[OFFSET]     - Current time, with optional offset.
            epoch[OFFSET]   - TLE reference time, with optional offset. Default.
            SECONDS[OFFSET] - Time in seconds since 0:0:0 UTC 1 Jan 1970.
            TIMESTAMP       - Time in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS UTC" format.
        OFFSET format is a +/- number followed by s, m, h, or d, indicating the
        offset unit (seconds, minutes, hours, or days, respectively).

    --end/e now | epoch | TIME | UNIXTIME
        If specified, trace is output from --start to no later than --end. If
        not specified, trace is output for the specified number of --steps.
        Same argument format as --start. The --end time must be later than the
        --start time. The time interval between --start and --end must be
        greater than the step --interval.

    --forceend
        Causes a final feature to be output exactly at --end time, regardless of
        interval. Has no effect if --end is not specified.

    --steps/-n STEPS
        Number of steps to output. Defaults to 1. Ignored if --end is given.

    --interval/-l DURATION
        Step interval. Duration format is a number followed by s, m, h, or d,
        indicating the unit (seconds, minutes, hours, or days, respectively).

  MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS:

    --verbose
        Print status messages (including coordinates and attribute values).

    --help/-?
        Display this usage message.

    --version/-v
        Display the program version.
